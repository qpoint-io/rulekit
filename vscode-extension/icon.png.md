# Icon Placeholder

Place a 128x128px (or larger) PNG icon here named `icon.png`.

The icon will be displayed in:
- VS Code Marketplace
- Extensions view
- File icons for `.rk` files

Recommended:
- Minimum size: 128x128px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Simple, recognizable symbol related to rules/filtering
- Colors: Work well on both light and dark backgrounds

For now, you can either:
1. Create a proper icon
2. Use any placeholder PNG and rename it to `icon.png`
3. Remove the `"icon"` field from package.json temporarily
